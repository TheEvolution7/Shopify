Discipline and consistency are both key factors in maintaining that lifestyle. Part of that discipline is knowing that if you want to get up in the morning to get your workout done, you cannot be out drinking the night before. As a businessman, that discipline is always being tested as so much of my business is done through networking over drinks at night during the week. So naturally, when my colleague and good friend, introduced me to Tak Yoo and to his company, BYS, I was intrigued.<\/p><p><br\/><\/p><p>The BYS products are game changers for me because they prevent those hangovers from happening in the first place. They contain natural ingredients that prevent hangovers simply by taking the product before you begin drinking. As an entrepreneur and a former NFL athlete still heavily rooted in the sports, health and wellness arenas of business, when I experienced first-hand how effective the BYS products were, the obvious next step for me was to pursue investing in BYS myself.<\/p>","text":"Sean James - COO"}},"collection-template":{"type":"collection-template","settings":{"bg":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/bg_1f49fdbe-34df-4b4e-80fc-0c56e695695a.jpg"}},"contact-template":{"type":"contact-template","settings":{"bg":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/bg_1f49fdbe-34df-4b4e-80fc-0c56e695695a.jpg","map":"<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2992.389322962748!2d-75.6703627842962!3d41.40906667926233!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x89c4df29ef5c8213%3A0xeff4003a0027d192!2s201%20Lackawanna%20Ave%2C%20Scranton%2C%20PA%2018503!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1636344286576!5m2!1sen!2sus\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" style=\"border:0;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"><\/iframe>","heading_1":"Our Location","address_1":"<p><strong>Headquarters<\/strong><\/p><p>201 Lackawanna Ave<\/p><p> Suite# 213<\/p><p> Scranton PA 18503<\/p>","address_2":"<p><strong> Manhattan Office<\/strong><\/p><p>100 Riverside Blvd<br\/> New York NY 10069<\/p>","heading_2":"Contact Us","phone":"","email":"<p><a href=\"mailto:info@buybys.com\" title=\"mailto:info@buybys.com\">info@buybys.com<\/a><\/p>","title":"Get In Touch","subtitle":"Contact Us"}},"product-template":{"type":"product-template","settings":{"bg":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/bg_1f49fdbe-34df-4b4e-80fc-0c56e695695a.jpg"}},"banner-home-2":{"type":"banner-home-2","settings":{"bg2":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/bys_Welness-BlackFriday-banner.jpg","url2":"shopify:\/\/collections\/all"}}},"content_for_index":[]}}
